# Welcome to JSOperators.com

## The purpose

JSOperators was created to give you a quick way to search and learn about most Javascript operators; more like a cheat sheet if you will.

## Development

This app is created in Remix. In order to get started, `clone` the repo, run `npm i`, then run `npm run dev` to spin up the app locally.

### Adding an operator

For right now if you want to add an operator, add it to the constant `operators.tsx` file. Then, add a corresponding markdown file in the operators folder. This file is where you'll add everything about the operator.

In a perfect world, it would be cool if all the necessary info regarding an operator could be added to the frontmatter portion of the markdown. Then we could forgo the operators constant and the redundancy of having it defined in two places.

## Contributing

Keep an eye out on the issues for this repo, though there may not be many. If you see an operator or a Javascript concept that is missing that you think would be a good fit for JSOperators, feel free to reach out to Tyrel, or perhaps create an issue, or open a PR with your desired changes.
